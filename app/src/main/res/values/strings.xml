We are a center for community engagement, a hub for underrepresented voices and music, an environment for professional development, and a catalyst for social justice.In 2012, a group of University of Washington Bothell students who shared a common interest in community media began building a radio station from scratch.We started broadcasting online in the spring of 2013 with a mixture of talk, music, and educational programming.Over the last year,we applied and were approved for a Low Power FM license from the FCC. You can view our future broadcast range here. Within the next year, we hope our listeners will be tuning in from their homes, work, cars, and online. We are growing every day!Business is in charge of the little details: underwriting content, legal inquiries, fundraising, connecting with local businesses, etc.Programming manages on-air content. They organize shows, curate the music library, and train new hosts and DJs.Promotions is the voice of UWave. They get the word out about volunteer opportunities, fundraisers and upcoming events.Technology runs the computers, website and audio equipment, including the studio and servers.If you have any questions or otherwise need to get in touch with us, the best way is just to email info@uwave.fmTo contact a specific department:• Business - business@uwave.fm• Programming - programming@uwave.fm• Promotions - promotions@uwave.fm• Technology - tech@uwave.fm"    </string>    <string name="schedule_text">"Schedule Coming Soon!"</string>    <string name="stream_button"></string>    <string name="contact_us">Contact UWave    "If you have any questions or otherwise need to get in touch with us, the best way is just to email info@uwave.fm.To contact a specific department:Business: business@uwave.fmProgramming: programming@uwave.fmPromotions: promotions@uwave.fmTechnology: tech@uwave.fm"</string>    <string name="community_text">Coming Soon!</string>    <string name="API_KEY">AIzaSyAv3pYp_27948eauMzDIt2Np8UDhaysMMg</string>    <string name="sign_out">Sign Out</string>    <string name="contacts_permission_rationale">Access to account information is required to sign in.</string>    <string name="banner_ad_unit_id" translatable="false">ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111</string>    <string name="action_sign_in_short">Register</string>    <string name="email">Email</string>    <string name="minimum_password">Password too short, enter minimum 6 characters!</string>    <string name="auth_failed">Authentication failed, check your email and password or sign up</string>    <string name="change_email">Change Email</string>    <string name="change_password">Change Password</string>    <string name="send_password_reset_email">Send Password reset email</string>    <string name="remove_user">Remove user</string>    <string name="new_pass">New Password</string>    <string name="title_activity_profile">Firebase</string>    <string name="title_activity_login">Sign in</string>    <string name="hint_email">Email</string>    <string name="hint_password">Password</string>    <string name="hint_name">Fullname</string>    <string name="btn_login">LOGIN</string>    <string name="btn_link_to_register">Not a member?
